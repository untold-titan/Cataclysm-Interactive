# Some of my favorite projects?
I think my favorite project I've done on this Github is probably Kirbo-Bot. Its a discord bot I made for me and friends to play around with in our discord.
Speaking of, If you wanna join my discord server, here's the link: [Army Gang](https://discord.gg/Muaepz4u9G)

I think my other favorite project is Baller. It's my first ever mobile game I made, using Unity and C#. Its really cool, and at it's peak, it had 50 users. It also has a crap ton of features I put into it. [Baller on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PentagonGames.Baller)

# What I'm learning right now
I'm currently looking into more web development libraries, and I'm looking into lower level languages, and how to implement them around me. (C and C++)

# My tech stack
I flip flop around with different tech stacks, depending on what the project requires. 

# Things about me!
 - I'm from Canada. üçÅ
 - I'm also working on moving my custom backend that I created, (cataclysmAPI) and moving it to Firebase so I have less code to maintain
 - Ask me about anything, you can reach me in my discord server, [Army Gang](https://discord.gg/Muaepz4u9G) (I'm Titan, the friendly neighbourhood admin) 
 - If you don't have discord, you can also reach me at untoldtitan3k@gmail.com.
 - Pronous: He/Him
 - Fun fact, I love Marvel and Pokemon. My favorite superhero is Iron man, followed by Spiderman. My favorite (non-mythic/legendary) pokemon is Sylveon, and my favorite legendary is Rayquaza.
